# Time Series Evaluator

Welcome to the Time Series Evaluator (TSE)! 
The TSE is a repository of metrics to evaluate time series
quality in several dimensions of analysis such as noise level
noise color, completeness, uniqueness, saturation, among other
options. Accordingly, visualization maps are drawn and can be 
plotted, allowing the user to observe and choose the quality levels
of the dataset. As the main purpose of these metrics is 
associated with the evaluation of real and synthetic data,
as well as, their similarity when applying Generative AI, 
the following figure illustrates the pipeline.
